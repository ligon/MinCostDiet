#+Title: Subsistence Cost Diet Project

With a growing world population, everybody's gotta eat.  The idea of
this project is to characterize /subsistence/ diets which deliver
adequate nutrition.  Formally, we're looking for the /minimum cost
diets/ for people of different types which nevertheless satisfy a set
of dietary requirements.

We're interested in answering questions of the form ("user story"):

   - "What is the minimum cost of adequately feeding <some population>
     given prices for <some menu of food>?

* Deliverables
  We'll start this project with a working prototype, for you to
  explore improving and exploring.

   - A :: These deliverables are
          /required/.  Note that other
          deliverables may rely on
          completion of A deliverables.
   - B :: These deliverables are /very
          desirable/.
   - C :: These deliverables would be
          /nice to have/.

** [#A] Description of population of interest
   This may be the most important decision you have to make.  The
   minimum cost diet for vegan students in Berkeley will almost certainly be
   different from the minimum cost diet for rural villagers in India. 

   What population are you interested in?  Contrasts may also be
   interesting.  Some examples:

   - Vegans vs. omnivores in Berkeley 
   - Refugees in Uganda
   - The world population
   - People who eat only at McDonalds
   - Berkeley students living in Co-ops
   - Americans in 1950 vs. Americans today
   - The Indian population (perhaps accounting for dietary
     restrictions related to religion)

** [#A] Dietary Reference Intakes
   Write a function that takes as arguments the characteristics of a
   person (e.g., age, sex) and returns a =pandas.Series= of Dietary Reference
   Intakes (DRI's) or "Recommended Daily Allowances" (RDA) of a
   variety of nutrients appropriate for your population of interest.

** [#A] Data on prices for different foods
   Construct a google spreadsheet of different prices of different
   kinds of food.  The different foods should be keyed to the USDA's
   /Food Data Central/ database (https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/)

   The foods and prices you use will vary depending on context and the
   particular population of people you're concerned with.  For
   example, if you're concerned with people who eat only at McDonald's,
   you'll want prices and nutritional information for the McDonald's
   menu.  If you want to think of minimum cost organic diet, you
   should consider a wide range of different organic foods.

** [#A] Nutritional content of different foods
   For all the foods you're considering you'll need to be able to
   describe their nutritional content, in terms that allow you to
   compare with recommended daily allowances.  We'll provide pointers
   to US government recommendations, but many other countries have
   their own recommendations, which may be better suited to their
   populations.
** [#A] Solution
   What is the minimum cost diet for the population you're concerned
   with?  How much does it cost, and of what does it consist?  How
   does it vary with age, sex, and level of activity?

** [#B] Is your solution edible?
   Turn your minimum cost diet into a meal.  Make enough for the whole
   class.  If making your diet palatable requires adding additional
   ingredients (e.g., salt or other spices) be sure to document this
   and account for it in the overall cost. 

   Whose meal is least costly?  Whose is most tasty?

** [#C] Sensitivity of Solution
   In general, your solution will depend on relative prices of
   different kinds of food.  And these prices can be quite volatile;
   for example, the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables usually
   exhibit a great deal of seasonal variation.  If the price of a
   particular kind of food increases by x%, how much does price of
   diet change, and how does the composition of the diet change?  

   Try and find an nice way to visualize these changes. 

** [#B] What is total cost for population of interest?

   You've been interested in a particular population.  It is likely to
   consist of people of different sexes, ages, and levels of
   activity.   How much food would be required to feed the entire
   population of interest?  At what cost?  (You may want to go back to
   the Population Project and look at counts of people by age and sex
   for different countries).

** [#B] Review of Your Code
   Have someone outside your group review your code.  This need not
   wait until your code is final---a more productive code reviewer may
   happen earlier in the process.  The most basic review will just
   verify that someone else can run your code, but will also usually
   involve reading over the code, identifying bugs, suggesting design
   improvements, etc.  You can document the review by asking the
   reviewer to use =github.com= Issues.

** [#B] Review of Another Group's Code
   Just as you've asked some other person or group to review your
   code, serve as a reviewer for some other groups' code.  The most
   basic review will just verify that someone else can run your code,
   but will also usually involve reading over the code, identifying
   bugs, suggesting design improvements, etc.  You can document the
   review by submitting issues on =github.com=.

** [#A] Presentation

   Each group will be responsible for giving a 15 minute demonstration
   of the work they've accomplished during the sprint.  Be creative!
   Think of awesome new ways to help others visualize what you've
   learned.
